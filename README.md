# BitWanga

BitWanga, a short path to value for social activities, including business.

Own your bank. Own your social links. Own your privacy. Own your justice.
Wear and use naturaly your telecom infrastructure as your digital institution. 

# Societal mathematics

You protect your privacy when direct and efficient human interactions.

Bitwanga layer 3 = Economic protocol + Social Protocol. 

Protocols both economic and social exist, with a mix, we created digital justice, compatible with all human activities.
Digital and autonomous, we build a system without boring management, delagation nor central attributions / references.

# Guide line

It's a project for coders.

We code a clever use of research and engineering, in various fields in order to offer operational solutions to the real problems and opportunities of a digital world.

## Free and Open

* Free to use
* Free to contribute
* Free to fork
* Free to hack
* Opensource (when ready for)
* No intellectual property

## Not wanted

* Attribution (no specific right, no minimums, no acceptance or formalization required, free participation)
* Complexity (root of centralization)
* Governance (including staking or professional requirements, light infrastructures)
* Smart contract (signatures can do the job)
* Fundation (too much private hands-on with fundations)

## Funding

I advance without. We'll see.

* No national "help".
* No corporate "help".
* No sponsor.
* No "star".
