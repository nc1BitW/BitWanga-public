# From where

The internet was great, but now it's dangerous to share information on it.
It is dangerous for everyone and for all industries.

We firmly believe that our digital and global lives must find a new type of organization, more secure, open, more shareable, more verifiable with less need for trust and less platforms, operators, regulators and third parties.

We have helped startups, major cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects in their goal to disseminate new tools to protect our privacy for our messages and securities transactions. We have partnered with major European companies to find and deploy new opportunities for great cooperation, future currency competition, better management of their value chain, a better way to engage people and communities with their industries. We have lobbied institutions, helped with new laws and to understand what kind of societal and economic changes are going to happen; how they can be among those who build the future.

The result is not good, the projects are for many in a polished parrellis, the industries are for many "customers", the institutions focus a lot on the protection of their national forces. No one is understandable by others and the lost in translation are everywhere and few are really able to exploit the opportunities of openness and make themselves accessible to others.

The gap is therefore enormous.

To overcome this, we propose to create a transition from the real Web to another, with a kind of abstraction with a mixer above the Web APIs.

The idea is to be able to gradually migrate metadata to better channels (Public / Private / Confidential) and flows to better infrastructures (cryptocurrencies and blockchains, decentralized solutions, signature process in protocols, mesh infrastructures secure space to secure this new Internet at no environmental cost).

In the end, we believe that the mobile phone is not the best device to make our digital lives work, and we want to offer portable clothing for everyday use.

So that everyone can contribute to this migration, we want to offer a structured, documented project that is technically accessible to as many people as possible.

We do not think that fundamental research is necessary at this stage to allow this transformation, all the necessary bricks already exist. We will ensure a simple and as open as possible implementation of cryptographic, consensus, telecoms, software and hardware.

Technically, our main effort is to make security accessible. For this, the code will be both ultra-secure and at the same time it will be simple to implement and verify the code. For the project, there is a new type of formal verification of the computer code which will no longer be reserved for PhDs only.

But's it's not just a distance problem

Economic incentive is not the best community vector. The value of links that motivates communities is rarely monetary. The strength of social contributions must also be taken into account to better moderate certain drifts observed either in foundations or in exchanges or in industrialists and favor strongly social approaches.

There is no justice in a system without social collateral.

At the current stage of digitalization of the companies the social bonds are worth the physical bonds. Better it is possible to better protect physical ties by collating social ties. This is the principle of a prison in the event of misconduct, except that digitalization makes it possible to collate isolation before harm.

We therefore worked to define a system whose links between the actors are applicable to all human activities, without daily containment.

# BitWanga

BitWanga, a short path to value for social activities, including business.

Own your bank. Own your social links. Own your privacy. Own your justice.
Wear and use naturaly your telecom infrastructure as your digital institution. 

# Societal mathematics

You protect your privacy when direct and efficient human interactions.

Bitwanga layer 3 = Economic protocol/collateral + Social Protocol/collateral. 

Protocols both economic and social exist, with a mix, we created digital justice, compatible with all human activities.
Digital and autonomous, we build a system without boring management, delagation nor central attributions / references.

# Guide line

It's a project for coders.

We code a clever use of research and engineering, in various fields in order to offer operational solutions to the real problems and opportunities of a digital world.

## Free and Open

* Free to use
* Free to contribute
* Free to fork
* Free to hack
* Opensource (when ready for)
* No intellectual property

## Not wanted

* Attribution (no specific right, no minimums, no acceptance or formalization required, free participation)
* Complexity (root of centralization and bugs)
* Governance (including staking or professional requirements)
* Smart contract (signatures can do the job)
* Fundation (too much private hands-on with fundations)

## Funding

We can move on without. We'll see.

* No national "help"
* No corporate "help"
* No sponsor
* No "star"
